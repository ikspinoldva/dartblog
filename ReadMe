This is a teaching project with a visual part taken from the internet. 
On this project I learned how to fill visual templates with my own Python/Django code, edit html pages and find elements of interest in java script code.

The main page displays the main article and 4 articles by pagination. In the navbar you can select the category of articles shown.
When you go to an article, you can search the articles, select articles by tags and popular articles. 
I also plan to implement the ability to comment on articles and logging users.
